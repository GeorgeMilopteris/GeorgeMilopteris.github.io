							<h1>Profile Introduction</h1>
							<p class="major"> I’m George Milopteris and I am from Bentleigh, Melbourne, Victoria.
		<br>							
		I am Greek although I was born here in Melbourne. I can speak Greek but not fluently.
		<br>								
		I’ve completed 13 years of primary and secondary schooling at Mckinnon Primary and Secondary Schools and i'm currently in my first year of completing a Bachelor Degree of IT (Information Technology) at RMIT, in which my RMIT ID is s3780800 and email address is s3780800@student.rmit.edu.au.
		<br>
		My main hobby at the moment is playing video games, although I also very much enjoy listening to music, watching AFL (mainly Richmond) and UFC. </p>

							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>I have a very passionate interest in IT and this begun ever since I was young when I started playing video games, as I spent a lot of my time with my computer. Also ever since I was little i’ve been intrigued by my uncles work as he has his own IT business.
		<br>
			I chose to come to RMIT as I reviewed all the other IT courses in Melbourne and RMITs’ peaked my interest the most as it seemed more attractive compared to Monashs’ IT course for example. As it seemed less theoretical and more practical than all the other courses, which I prefer.
		<br>
			I expect to learn all about all kinds of technology and the basic in most fields, but i’m unsure at the moment what I want to major in specifically, so I don’t really know fully what i’m going to learn. But I hope it's something I enjoy and am willing to pursue a career in.

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p> UX researcher
<br>
A UX (User Experience) researcher investigates users and their requirements, through the use of various techniques, tools and methodologies, in which their investigation is then used to assist the developer by proposing certain aspects requiring change in order to improve UX. 
<br>
This is appealing to me as the job seems like it work both independently and in group projects, additionally UX is very important for a successful application or website, as from personally experience if I have trouble using an application or website I will generally not revisit it.
<br>
The skills and requirements for this job vary as it is a fairly new industry generally for this job though, the recommended experience in this area of work is 0-4 years. There isn’t a course at the moment in Australia that I know of that has a major in UX, so the qualifications vary although many researchers, have graduated with either some sort of IT course, or a communication course. The general skills required are strong communication and organisation the normal skills required for most jobs. 
<br>
ME
<br>
Education: Finished Year 12 and currently attending University
								<br>
Experience: Yet to have any work experience/ a job.
								<br>
Skills: Pretty good communication and organisation skills, and pretty good IT skills when it comes to using computers.
<br>
Firstly, in order to be able to work this position one day I need to finish a university degree either related to IT or a communication course. Secondly, i’d most likely need to extracurricular studying and have some sort of experience in the field of User Centred Design, as you cannot specifically major in it. Then, i’d most likely need to get any type of job experience just to further demonstrate to whomever I am applying to that I have work experience.

								These results don’t mean a whole lot to me, but they did make me reflect and helped me learn some things about myself. I also don't think these results will influence my behaviour in a team as I already know how i'm going to behave in a team. 
<br> These results should not be taken into account too heavily when forming a team however having a balanced mix of introverts and extraverts would allow for everyone to be involved  and work in unison. As for example if everyone is more introverted there’s a chance that there would not be as much communication and teamwork.

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<p> 
							Project Idea: A Survival Game
<br>
<br>
Summary: 
My Project will be a first person survival video game which would be played on PC. This game would be centred around PvP (Player vs Player) although there would be a few PvE (Player vs Entity) aspects to the game. This game would be set on an island with players starting with nothing and either surviving on their own or teaming up with a few friends in order to survive. The main focus of this game would be to get players to collect and craft items and progress from for example bows to assault rifles. Additionally players would need to build bases in order to store their loot, however players will be able to raid/break other players bases in order to take their loot. There would be a system in order for players to be able to progress, which would make players have to find higher tier or mid tier items by any means even if that means through pvp, then have to research these items in order to be able to craft them, themselves.
<br>
<br>
Motivation:

With there being many survival games available to play at the moment, with many being PvP focussed I don’t believe any of them fully utilise or correctly execute many exciting aspects/mechanics available to survival games. So this game would expand on those mechanics providing survival game enthusiasts with the best experience by refining each aspect. Additionally because I primarily play survival games i’ve realised that a strong line of communication with the developers and the community can lead to both good and bad in terms of updates, therefore another aspect of this project would be to allow for strong user input, however this would not take over the main development of this project.
<br>
<br>
Description:

This project will be a survival game played off PCs and would be able to be purchased from Steam (preferably), this game would cost $15 (USD).
<br>
This game would be played from the first perspective of your character, players would be randomly generated a character model when they launch the game, with every player having different but similar character models. Although through playing the game players will find and craft clothes in order to survive and customize the look of their characters, as some clothes will primarily be for cosmetic looks and others purely for defense (armour). 
<br>
As the game would be played from first-person it would be a first-person shooter as will developing through the players will need to be able to have weapons such as guns in order to combat other players in PvP. This will most likely form the basis of the game as players are forced to leave their bases to collect items they are susceptible to being killed and losing their items they have gathered. 
<br>
Therefore players are forced to build bases to store their loot/items from other players there would be a building system in place for players to be able to be creative and unique in their base design. This flexibility of building would then allow players to create bases in which are difficult to raid/break and so they can defend it from other players.
<br>
Therefore as building is a primary feature of this game then raiding is equally as important, although there would be no competition between players. So there would be a meticulous raiding system in place which allow players at all stages of the game to be able raid others. For example once players have reached the later stages and have the best weapons and armour they will most likely be able to raid others with rockets, explosives and more modern forms of explosives whereas players early on will be forced to raid with tools and primitive explosives such as hand made grenades etc. 
<br>
Similarly players will have access to various weapons starting at melee weapons such as swords and primitive weapons such as muskets and even bows and crossbows. Then as players progress they would get access to more modern weapons such as bolt rifles, ak-47’s M4’s, homemade rifles and more variants of different guns ranging from full automatic to semi automatic. This is to ensure players have a wide variety of choice and preference to guns they would like to use and play with. 
<br>
To increase/encourage PvP there would certain locations across the map which building is restricted and is where better tier loot spawns for players to be able to loot and try their luck. This would therefore cause players to fight of these items hence, these locations would also range from more basic ones and more modern/higher tier ones.
<br>
<br>
Tools and Technologies:

This game would run on a Unity engine, and would require an office or group of developers to have PCs in order to constantly update and provide a quality experience. Players would all require internet to download and play this game as it would be 100% played online versus other players. This would most likely require the developers to use various applications such as github to share to and experiment with code, as well due to githubs flexibility and accessibility. 
<br>
<br>
Skills Required:

Firstly, there would need to be a development dedicated to creating this project, who all have extensive knowledge and skill with Unity and game development. At this current point in time with my knowledge and access to such hardware I do not believe that it would be possible for me to develop such a project. However in the future, finding and acquire these skills would take some time studying and developing and would then be a potential career path/ feasible option. 
<br>
<br>
Outcome:

If this project were to ever be successful, then it would not only make my life more enjoyable but others as well who have been looking for a more complete and solid survival game, to enjoy and entertain themselves. Depending on the success of this game it could also cause a shift in many survival games to then focus on improving their game to be able to keep their player base resulting in more quality games for everyone to enjoy.
