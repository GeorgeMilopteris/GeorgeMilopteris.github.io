							<h1>Profile Introduction</h1>
							<p class="major"> I’m George Milopteris and I am from Bentleigh, Melbourne, Victoria.
		<br>							
		I am Greek although I was born here in Melbourne. I can speak Greek but not fluently.
		<br>								
		I’ve completed 13 years of primary and secondary schooling at Mckinnon Primary and Secondary Schools and i'm currently in my first year of completing a Bachelor Degree of IT (Information Technology) at RMIT, in which my RMIT ID is s3780800 and email address is s3780800@student.rmit.edu.au.
		<br>
		My main hobby at the moment is playing video games such as Rust, I also very much enjoy listening to music, watching AFL (mainly Richmond) and UFC. </p>

							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>I have a very passionate interest in IT and this begun ever since I was young when I started playing video games, as I spent a lot of my time with my computer. Also ever since I was little i’ve been intrigued by my uncles work as he has his own IT business.
		<br>
			I chose to come to RMIT as I reviewed all the other IT courses in Melbourne and RMITs’ peaked my interest the most as it seemed more attractive compared to Monashs’ IT course for example. As it seemed less theoretical and more practical than all the other courses, which I prefer.
		<br>
			I expect to learn all about all kinds of technology and the basic in most fields, but i’m unsure at the moment what I want to major in specifically, so I don’t really know fully what i’m going to learn. But I hope it's something I enjoy and am willing to pursue a career in.

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p> UX researcher
<br>
A UX (User Experience) researcher investigates users and their requirements, through the use of various techniques, tools and methodologies, in which their investigation is then used to assist the developer by proposing certain aspects requiring change in order to improve UX. 
<br>
This is appealing to me as the job seems like it work both independently and in group projects, additionally UX is very important for a successful application or website, as from personally experience if I have trouble using an application or website I will generally not revisit it.
<br>
The skills and requirements for this job vary as it is a fairly new industry generally for this job though, the recommended experience in this area of work is 0-4 years. There isn’t a course at the moment in Australia that I know of that has a major in UX, so the qualifications vary although many researchers, have graduated with either some sort of IT course, or a communication course. The general skills required are strong communication and organisation the normal skills required for most jobs. 
<br>
ME
<br>
Education: Finished Year 12 and currently attending University
								<br>
Experience: Yet to have any work experience/ a job.
								<br>
Skills: Pretty good communication and organisation skills, and pretty good IT skills when it comes to using computers.
<br>
Firstly, in order to be able to work this position one day I need to finish a university degree either related to IT or a communication course. Secondly, i’d most likely need to extracurricular studying and have some sort of experience in the field of User Centred Design, as you cannot specifically major in it. Then, i’d most likely need to get any type of job experience just to further demonstrate to whomever I am applying to that I have work experience.
